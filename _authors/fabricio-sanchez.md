I'm currently responsible for driving and executing transformational projects and leading technical teams in the education sector, leveraging my expertise in cloud computing, digital transformation, and application modernization and Artificial Intelligence. I've gathered a bit more than 20 years of experience in the tech industry (yes, I'm getting old).

Throghout my career I was lucky enough for being able to form a diverse and rich background, having served in various roles and industries. I co-founded and currently lead the content creation are of [Cloud Casters](https://cloudcasters.io), a podcast that discusses cloud topics in a relaxed and deeply informative way, and that has seen a terrific growth in audience (+800%) QoQ. Over my career, I have helped on developing and designed hundreds of high-scalable solutions which are mostly used by millions of users every day sitting on all the three main cloud providers: Google, Microsoft and AWS. I have also successfuly led technical teams of both engineers and tech sales, helping companies like Microsoft, Google, UCB and Conio Technologies on reaching out their growth goals.

I do hold a bachelor's degree in computer science and a master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil and dozens of official certifications. As well, I'm a Google Cloud Certified Professional (GCCP), Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) and Microsoft Certified Professional (MCPS).
