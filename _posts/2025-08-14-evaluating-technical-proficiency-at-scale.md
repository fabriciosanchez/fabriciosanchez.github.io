Functional illiteracy represents a profound and often underestimated challenge across the globe, confronting governments and societies worldwide. Far more complex than the mere inability to read or write, it signifies a deficit in the practical application of literacy skills necessary for navigating the demands of modern life. This article delves into the intricate nature of functional illiteracy, quantifies its pervasive impact across economic, health, and civic spheres, and explores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (especially Generative AI) in fostering a more literate and equitable global society. It also introduces an open-source initiative we've been piloting at Google that targets that very need.

## The Silent Crisis: Understanding Functional Illiteracy

Functional illiteracy is a nuanced concept, distinct from absolute illiteracy where one shows a complete inability of performing basic cognitive activities, such as reading, writing, and so on.

[Barbara Bush Literacy Foundation](https://www.houstonadultliteracy.org/functionalliteracy) describes functional illiteracy as "lack of skills of a individual to function in their roles on the job, in the family, and across society". Routine activities that are usully affected by functional illiteracy are:

* Making decisions about personal finances.
* Understanding a doctorâ€™s advice or instructions for prescription drugs.
* Navigating transportation maps and schedules.
* Searching for and making an appointment online.
* Reading and following workplace safety manuals.
* Helping a child with homework and developing their literacy skills.
* Learning something new through an online platform.
* Among others

Because of that, its measurement is far more complex to assess, especially at scale and requires sophisticated assessment tools and naturally poses a pervasive, often hidden, problem that undermines individual potential and societal progress.
