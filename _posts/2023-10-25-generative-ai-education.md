When the shift towards cloud computing happened in the market years ago, I remember seeing  myself in meetings full of people explaining about what this new consumption-based business was all about and how the way of thinking the whole process of innovation and IT would need to change for this to make sense to companies. Right, I mean, moving virtual machines from on-prem to the public just to say “hey, my company runs on the cloud” didn’t (and still doesn’t) add any value to the business itself.

More than that. Even the sales teams of those cloud providers didn’t understand exactly that selling cloud wasn’t about licensing anymore. It was about projects, which would require them to understand the industry, the solutions, the workloads and so on and so forth.

Why am I saying all this? Because we’re on the Edge of a new market shift and its name is Generative AI (a subarea of Artificial Intelligence) this is going to put the market upside down once again and that necessarily means that our mental model will need to shift (again) with it.

We’re living the convergence of computational power (provided by the cloud), maturity of AI (specially GenAI) as a technology reachable to every human being, API economy as a workable business model and industry knowledge. How exciting is this?!

## Why Generative AI is the shift and not AI as a whole?

Well, you might have heard that already but it is never too much remembering that Artificial Intelligence has been there for a while. We have actually used it on a daily-basis for years already (who here has never translated a sentence in Google Translator, for instance?). However, despite all the efforts of these big companies over the years on trying to ship that technology more broadly, it didn’t seem to be something that the market was aiming for and most importantly, was willing to invest on.

Well, then ChatGPT happened and suddenly people started to realize that now machines could really generate new and very, very accurate responses to problems of all sorts: STEM, history, languages. Scarcely good answers and that caught the attention of the market.

When I think about “why” cloud suddenly became a thing in the market in 2008, it is easy to understand the huge benefits promised by it: paying only of what its been used, automation, SLA levels that less the 5% of the organizations globally would dream about, focus on the solution and not in the infra. It is a lot, especially considering the complexity and how expensive hardware and software was at that point.

Now, when I reflect about Generative AI and the reason by which people got so fascinated by the delivery of the technology, there is one main aspect that comes to my mind and which, in my humble opinion will drive the shift in the industry: **use cases**.

I know, while you were reading this you probably thought about a dozen use cases where ChatGPT, Bard and other Generative technologies could help you deliver, right? It's natural because this is all about humanity, right? I mean, if your company needs to write an ebook about a product for instance, hire a writer, brief them about the content and see the results a couple of months later. Well, could you see Generative AI doing that work? I could. Easily. At no cost and quicker.

That’s the reason. Think about a task or process in your daily life or organization. Things that are not out of ordinary but that necessarily need people to perform. Well, that process or task is what we call “use case” and there is a big chance it can (or will be able to soon) be performed by a good mechanism powered by Generative AI.

So, responding to the initial question that started off the discussion in this section: Why Generative AI is the shift and no AI as whole? The direct answer is: is because it is very simple to think about a use case (which are usually very tied to the industry), see Generative AI solving it and then, with technology and data (a lot of good and accurate data) act upon it.

Putting this in a different perspective, it is more like Generative AI is now able to solve challenges that (until now) only humans could, like generating a poem, writing a music, creating a video, summarizing a book, explaining a complex legal contract, and the list goes on. All these? Yes, they’re use cases for Generative AI.

## What changes then?
